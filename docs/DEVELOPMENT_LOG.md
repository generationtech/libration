# Development log

Append-only. One short entry per completed work item. Current state lives in [`docs/STATE.md`](STATE.md); do not duplicate it here.

Do not copy a work item’s full completion record. Do not import pre-modernization history from [`docs/history/`](history/).

## 2026-08-14 — Ratchet initialized

Installed the development ratchet after modernization M0–M2: `docs/STATE.md`, this log, `docs/WORKFLOW.md`, `docs/work/`, and a rewritten `docs/ROADMAP.md`. First work item is approved [`LIB-001`](work/LIB-001-cursor-native-visual-verification.md) (visual verification / M4). M0–M2 were not given LIB identifiers.

Verified: documentation/process checks plus `npx tsc --noEmit` (clean) and `npm test` (pre-existing 1 failed / 1478 passed; see `docs/STATE.md`).
